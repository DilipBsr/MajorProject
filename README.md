Sign Language Test using cnn

The Sign Language Testing Web App is an interactive educational platform designed to help users learn and test their knowledge of Indian Sign Language (ISL). The application leverages Machine Learning, Computer Vision, and a user-friendly web interface to recognize hand gestures in real time using a webcam.

Users can take tests based on:
Numbers (0–9)
Alphabets (A–Z)Indian and American Sign

The system captures webcam input, processes it through a Flask backend with a trained ML model (e.g., TensorFlow/Keras or YOLO), and returns the detected sign. The React frontend displays the result with visual feedback, scoring, and even certificates for completed tests.
